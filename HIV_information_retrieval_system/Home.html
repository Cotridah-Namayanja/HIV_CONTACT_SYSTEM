        <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. <br> If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
            There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life. <br>
            But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. People with HIV who get effective HIV treatment can live long, healthy lives and protect their partners.</p>

            <p><b> Poor health Outcome. </b>Without regular access to HIV treatment and care, one may experience a decline in health, including CDR counts, Viral loads among others</p>
            <p><b> Rx Failure. </b>If a patient stops taking their ART medication or does not take it as prescribed, they may develop drug resistance which can make their HIV infection more difficult to treat.</p>
            <video src="images/treatment.mp4" width="600px" height="360px" controls></video>
            <p><b>Increased risk of transmission. </b>Patients who are not engaged in care and not taking their ART medication as prescribed are at a higher risk of transmitting HIV to others.</p>
            <p><b>Missed opportunities for prevention. </b>Patients who are not engaged in care may not receive prevention services such as HIV testing, counseling on safer sex services and screening for other sexually transmitted infections.</p>
            <img src="images/drug6.jfif" width="600px" height="300px" alt="">
            <p><b> Higher Healthcare costs. </b>Patients who lost contact  may eventually seek care at a later stage of their illness, which can result in higher heath care costs themselves and Healthcare systems.</p>
